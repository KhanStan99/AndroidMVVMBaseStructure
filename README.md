# AndroidMVVMBaseStructure

I have created this base template as a started kit for Android Project.

Features:
- Uses MVVM architecture.
- Uses retrofit2.
- Uses coroutines and kodein.
- Saves a lot of time as it has already written all the boiler plate code.

TODO: I will add RoomDB shortly to this project. Thanks :)
